### Disk thoughts

1. Keeping multiple classes: can either store a dict / list using jsonpickle or so of everything needed. Alternatively, add class
based on filename. I prefer the first solution (not as clean, probably, but as long as the user is not stupid enough to delete
the files, I should be fine)
