## TODOs
Collection of ideas, "feature requests", TODOs in code, ..

categorization:
[1]: important functionality to be added
[2]: nice to have functionality, or doing things more properly / cleanly
[3]: allowing stuff to be distributed cross platform and be used by more than just one user / one system
[4]: nice-to-have-features if I want to build this thing BIG

- [3] Distinguish between filesystem => use os.path.join() for filepaths, ...
- [2] sanitize user inputs everywhere
- [2] clean up code
- [2] make nice exam summaries
- [1] consistently use xlsx as default instead of csv
    - Except for where I need to load information from the disk.
- [1] permissions for files using `os.chmod(filename, 0o444), probably 0x664 (root can edit)
    - RW for all exam data
    - R on student list -- don't want users to mess with that
- [1] test the shit out of the bugger
- [1] do frontend
- [1] deal with loading / storing at startup / different times / ...
- [4] do the thing securely, like encrypting exam data, ...
- [1] use more functions for storage -- don't do it inline.
    - unclear what I meant here...
- [1] remove all stores inside backend code -- let the caller take care of that
- [3] proper logging everywhere
- [2] printing functions for student / category / ... classes, makes debugging easier
- [1] make sure implementation can deal with student not writing exams
- [1] add category mode streichnote
- [2] data persistence: how and when to store what
- [3] packaging -- create a single executable file from entire project
    - need to restructure project in a reasonable way
- [2] store all exams in same excel file instead of mulitple files
- [4] Add functionality for restoring stuff from the .trash folder within program
- [2] start "documentation" of workflows and project layout -- e.g., after calling method XY, class gets stored on disk automatically. After addign student, has to be invoked manually. Etc.
- [1] store the bugger on github -- maybe use protonmail for reasons.
- [2] deal with folderpath reasonably

### Disk thoughts

1. Keeping multiple classes: can either store a dict / list using jsonpickle or so of everything needed. Alternatively, add class
based on filename. I prefer the first solution (not as clean, probably, but as long as the user is not stupid enough to delete
the files, I should be fine)
=> settle on second, cleaner and less risk of users deleting important stuff. Also easier to fix, if they do.
